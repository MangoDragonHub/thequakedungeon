THE DIAMOND DUNGEON IS A MUTLIPLAYER QUAKE MAP THAT TAKES PLACE IN AN INTERCONNECTED DUNGEON WHERE THE MAP IS SHAPED LIKE A DIAMOND.

#GOALS WITH THIS PROJECT
THE GOAL WITH THIS PROJECT TO CREATE NOT ONLY AN INTERESTING MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE WITH THIS MAP BUT IT IS ALSO A LEARNING EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO CREATE A MAP USING THE QUAKE MAP EDITOR. WITH THE USE OF MUTLIPLE LAYERS OF ELEVATION AND AREAS DESIGNATED FOR COMBAT, THIS WILL USED AS A FOUNDATION TO MAKE FUN AND ALSO COMPETETIVE PLAYSPACE.

\*THIS MAP PROJECT IS CREATED TO WORK WITH PLAYER TEAMS IN MIND, IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED WHEN PLAYING SOLO DEATHMATCHES.*

# MAP SETTING
THIS MAP TAKES PLACE INSIDE OF AN UNDERGROUND DUNGEON THAT HAS BEEN HIDDEN FOR CENTURIES IN MIDEVIAL EUROPE. IT IS MEDIUM SIDED AND ITS CORE IS SHAPED LIKE A DIAMOND JUST TO SPERATE TRANSPORT BETWEEN THE OTHER PRISIONERS WHO WERE THERE AT THE TIME. BOTH TEAMS ARE NOW TRANSPORTED THERE, WITH NO VISABLE EXIT, AND EACH TEAM AS TO FIGHT EACH OTHER TO THE DEATH IN ORDER FOR THE EXIT TO APPEAR.
